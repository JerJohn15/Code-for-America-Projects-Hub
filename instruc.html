        <b>You will need a server to host our app</b>
            <ul><li>
                I recommend downloading
                <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/start.html?platform=windows&lang=en&option=php">Netbeans</a>
                for 2 reasons: it will run most applications that we have on code for america,
                also it is very useful with using git.(great IDE for beginers)

        <b>You need your own copy("fork") of this project</b>
